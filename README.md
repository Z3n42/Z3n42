### üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on

- Improving QA automation in the AI area at Telef√≥nica:  
  Designing, maintaining, and evaluating robust testing pipelines for Large Language Model (LLM) agents, including automated end-to-end and behavioral testing with frameworks like Behave (BDD).
- Testing and evaluating the performance and reliability of AI agents, focusing on conversational and autonomous agent scenarios.
- Developing and experimenting with LLM agents using Langraph, exploring new approaches to agent orchestration and evaluation.
- Advancing my collaborative learning projects: 
  - [**ft_transcendence**](https://github.com/Z3n42/ft_transcendence):  
  A full-stack Dockerized web application featuring a Django API, Angular landing page, and integrated dashboards (Grafana, Kibana, PGAdmin, RedisInsight). The project includes a versatile Makefile for orchestrating and managing all services.
  - [**Inception-of-Things (IoT)**](https://github.com/Mirgc/IoT):  
  A collection of system administration exercises focused on lightweight infrastructure and Kubernetes. It covers building clusters with Vagrant and K3s, deploying web applications with Traefik ingress, and automating CI/CD with Argo CD. Each part demonstrates incremental DevOps skills with practical scripts and automation.

### üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on

- DevOps, QA automation, and testing projects‚Äîespecially those involving AI or infrastructure.
- Open-source tools that blend infrastructure with development.
- Innovative uses of containers, Kubernetes, and LLM/AI agents in real-world scenarios.

### ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with

- Mastering advanced Kubernetes, cloud-native patterns, and AI agent evaluation.
- Expanding my knowledge in large-scale system automation and best practices for testing AI/LLM agents.

### üå± I‚Äôm currently learning

- Deeper Kubernetes, GitOps (Argo CD), cloud automation, and orchestration.
- New approaches to QA automation, monitoring, and agent evaluation for AI systems.

### üí¨ Ask me about

- System administration, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines.
- QA automation frameworks and best practices, especially for AI/LLM agents.
- 42 projects and how to combine infrastructure with development.
- Developing and orchestrating agents with Langraph.

### ‚ö° Fun fact

I started out studying languages and literature but found my true passion in tech. I love learning new programming languages just as much as spoken ones!
